Orientation Representation Converter (orc)
==========================================
Orc is a converter of spatial orientation representations developed primarily for the use in the field of Robotics.

It provides conversions between the following representations; Rotation Matrix, Quaternions, Angle Axis, Angle Axis With Magnitude and all 24 sets of Euler Angles. Orc is also capable of converting entire files line by line, which is especially useful for translating industrial manipulator scripts among different manufacturers. This tool allows the user to easily customise the conversion procedure and specify parameters of the input and output file lines (mouse over toolTips for help).

Note: Templates for file conversions (among manufacturers, etc.) are currently under construction.<br />
Note: This is my first individual application ever developed, therefore, please contact me if you find any bugs and/or have any suggestions.
